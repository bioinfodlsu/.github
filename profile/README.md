Hello! 

Welcome to the GitHub page of the **Bioinformatics Lab at De La Salle University, Manila**.

We build algorithms, software, and machine learning models to solve a wide range of problems in biology.

We work on algorithms and software for high-throughput sequencing data analysis, bioinformatics for diseases and epidemics, computer architecture for bioinformatics algorithms, and similar topics.

More information on the lab can be found at the lab's home page [here](https://www.bioinfodlsu.com).
